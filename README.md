# vscode-styled-jsx

Syntax highlighting for [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx)


Syntaxes files are inspired by [vscode-styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/vscode-styled-components.git)
Uses the CSS grammar from the Atom [language-babel](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel).
